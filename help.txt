. Install bee Tool Again
Since bee is not recognized, make sure that it's installed correctly by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
go install github.com/beego/bee/v2@latest
After this, check whether the bee binary was successfully installed in your $GOPATH/bin directory.

2. Verify the Installation Path
Ensure that the Go binaries are in the correct directory. The Go install path for binaries should be $GOPATH/bin. For example:

bash
Copy code
echo $GOPATH
Make sure it prints something like /home/w3e100/go. If it doesn't, recheck the setup for the $GOPATH.

Now, check if the bee tool is located in your $GOPATH/bin directory:

bash
Copy code
ls $GOPATH/bin
Look for a file named bee (without any file extension).

3. Make Sure the Go Binary Path Is in Your PATH
You need to ensure that the $GOPATH/bin directory is added to your system’s PATH. Double-check if the export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin command was correctly added to your .bashrc. You can confirm by running:

bash
Copy code
echo $PATH
Make sure that $GOPATH/bin is part of the output.

If it’s not there, you can manually add the path to your .bashrc:

bash
Copy code
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
4. Verify the Installation Again
Now, try to verify the bee tool:

bash
Copy code
bee version


go mod tidy
go mod verify
bee run
